# Introduction:
This repository documents completed work using Microsoft SQL Server and will continue to be updated as new SQL tasks are undertaken. Here, you can track my progression in SQL skills, including establishing relationships between fact and dimension tables, performing data cleaning, conducting data retrieval operations, and more. Each project includes a brief overview of the tasks and skills involved, facilitating a clear understanding of my SQL endeavors.

## 1. Covid Vaccine Project:
### dataset:
Covid Vaccination
### Goals:
1. Two methods used to alter date type , but the first one cannot work successfully and the second one is to create a new date column first then refer to the transformed date column.
2. Count null values in the dataset
3. Some duplicate records have values, some do not. How to populate missing values using another duplicate record.
4. Break out address values into individual columns.
5. Use case when function to change categorical values.
6. How to remove duplicate

## 2. Chicago Crime project:
### Dataset:
Chicago_crime_weather
### Goals:
1. Create tables and set up primary key and foreign keys. Concatenate all crime tables to create a new table. Build a schema between fact table and dimension tables.
2. Use count() function to extract criminal amount, and calculate the percentage of each type crime.
3. Find the median value of temperature which is a triky one due to no in-build median function in SQL.
4. Create Common Table Expression (CTE) to helo retrive complex figures.
5. Deal with date type data, including extract day of week, day of year, consecutive days of #crime#.
6. Find Year-to-Year growth of crime and Season-to Season growth of crime.
